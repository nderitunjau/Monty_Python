# Monty_Python
By the way, the language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and has nothing to do with reptiles. 
Making references to Monty Python skits in documentation is not only allowed, it is encouraged!
One of the most widely used programming languages worldwide is Python. Python, which was developed in the early 1990s, 
can be used for a variety of activities, including automating routine operations, creating web applications, machine learning models,
and neural networks. Python is popular among researchers, mathematicians, and data scientists in particular because to its rich and simple syntax 
and the variety of open-source packages it supports. Packages are publicly accessible, shared code libraries that anybody may use.
